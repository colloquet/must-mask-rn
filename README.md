## About Must Mask

With the recent situation, many people that ran out of masks are feeling extremely anxious and helpless. Stores occasionally have replenished stocks of masks, attract long queues from early morning. Many leave in disappointment after exposing themselves for hours in the queue.

On one hand, there are ones unable to buy masks, and on the other, ones that have enough supply to last a few months and are willing to help others.

In view of this, we have developed the Must Mask platform so that people who have exhausted their supplies can reach out to those who are willing to share. Helping each other to overcome the current situation and return to normal life.

Must Mask operating attributes:
* Uses GPS to mark location of shared masks
* Users can help each other locally, quickly and conveniently, facilitating social distancing and reducing risk for transmitting
* Only require a Facebook / Apple account to participate
* Free to use platform, the purpose is to reduce publicâ€™s anxiety and help restore everyone's normal lives
